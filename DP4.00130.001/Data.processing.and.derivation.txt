Continuous discharge is calculated using calibrated water level data from the same pressure sensor used to produce Elevation of surface water (DP1.20016.001), which is converted to units of stage using a regression equation. For regression information, see sdrc_gaugeWaterColumnRegression published in this data product. The stage values are then converted to discharge by applying the Stage-discharge rating curve (DP4.00133.001) that covers the apropriate time range using Bayesian BaRatin software (Le Coz et al., 2014; Horner et al., 2018). For a given water year, there will be one or more water column-stage regression models and one or more stage-discharge rating curves.
