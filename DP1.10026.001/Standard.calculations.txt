Analytical replicates, indicated by the field analyticalRepNumber, should typically be averaged to determine a single value per sample per analyte, before proceeding with further analyses. Additionally, if carbon and nitrogen were analyzed separately (co2Trapped = N and Y respectively), users may wish to combine these values first before joining to other tables.

The vst_mappingandtagging table is provided in the expanded package in this data product, for convenience in finding the stem locations of woody sampled plants. The vst geolocations are one way to enable connection to remote sensing data for the same locations. Note that individualIDs are sometimes re-mapped to fix geolocation issues, and while earlier records will eventually be removed users should take the latest record from an individualID in the mapping table before joining to other tables. An example workflow for bringing vegetation structure and canopy foliage data together using the neonUtilities package is described in a tutorial: https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/tree-heights-veg-structure-chm
