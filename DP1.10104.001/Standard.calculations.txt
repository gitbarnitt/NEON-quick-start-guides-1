Raw data are converted by the analytical laboratory into lipid concentrations using a calibration standard. Prior to November 1, 2021, extraction efficiencies were determined for each sample using a spiked internal standard, and unscaled concentrations were reported along with extraction efficiencies in sme_microbialBiomass for users to adjust lipid values based on sample extraction efficiency. Scaled concentrations are reported in sme_scaledMicrobialBiomass. Total lipid concentrations are calculated during NEON automated data ingest by adding all reported lipid concentrations; the number of lipids and extract types of lipids may change over time and may affect total calculated lipid concentrations.
