When discharge is measured using the ADCP, additional post-processing must be conducted in third party software before the data is entered into the mobile data entry application. Post-processing is a manual activity conducted by NEON Field Science staff to review and finalize the measurement. Stage-discharge rating curves (DP4.00133.001) are calculated using this data product, and Continuous discharge (DP4.00130.001) is calculated using the rating curves in combination with Elevation of surface water (DP1.20016.001). For users who prefer to calculate rating curves and continuous discharge using alternatives to NEON's algorithm, this data product contains the raw data needed as input. Refer to the ATBDs for details about NEON's algorithm and processing workflow.
