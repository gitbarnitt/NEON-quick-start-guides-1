At stream, river, and lake inflow/outflow locations, permanent discharge transects are located near sensor set 1 (S1) or sensor set 2 (S2) on a riffle or a run. Discharge may be collected using a flowmeter or an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). For flowmeter measurements, the meter, meter tape, and wading rod are used to collect point velocity and depth measurements across the stream with the goal of 20-25 evenly spaces measurements for streams with a width of more than 2m. The minimum distance between points is 0.05m regardless of stream width. For ADCP measurements, the instrument is moved across the width of the channel along the water surface via tethered rope system. Velocity, depth, and area are continuously measured, and discharge is measured for each transects. A minimum of four transects are required for each ADCP measurement. Staff gauge height is recorded before, during, and after each discharge measurement. Discharge is collected up to 24 times per year at stream and lake inflow/outflow locations, and 12 times per year at river locations.
