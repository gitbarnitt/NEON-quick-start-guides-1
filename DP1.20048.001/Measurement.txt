Stage (a.k.a, staff gauge height; m) and discharge (L/s) data are measured at each stream, river, and lake inflow/outflow location regularly throughout the water year. For each method employed (flowmeter, ADCP), associated metadata and method-specific variables are published in addition to the primary stage and discharge data.
