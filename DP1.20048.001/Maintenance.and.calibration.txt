When discharge is measured using the flowmeter, the meter is calibrated prior to data collection. This is done by placing the flowmeter and attached wading rod into a bucket of still stream water and verifying the velocity of the water in the bucket is 0. Before each. When discharge is measured using the ADCP, multiple quality assurance tests are performed prior to data collection, including 1) moving bed test, 2) compass calibration, 3) instrument diagnostic test (for more information, see the protocol and procedure document).
