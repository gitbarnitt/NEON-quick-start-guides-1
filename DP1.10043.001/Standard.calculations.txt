During the identification process any trap that appears to contain more than 200 mosquitoes is subsampled such that only a random subset of ~200 mosquitoes are identified. The laboratory reports the weight of the total sample, the subsample, and then the weight of all bycatch removed from the subsample.  The individualCount reported for subsampled traps should be corrected for the proportion of the sample analyzed.  To make this correction individualCount should be multiplied by totalWeight/subsampleWeight to estimate the full number of mosquitoes present in the trapped sample.
