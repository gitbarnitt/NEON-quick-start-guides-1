The sampleCondition field in the tck_pathogen table indicates the condition of the tested sample at the time of pathogen testing. The lab quality assurance data in the tck_pathogenqa table, in the expanded data package contains data on controls included during PCR testing. Each plate contains a positive control to verify detection of known pathogens as well as two negative controls (one extraction control and one master mix control) to check for contamination. Samples are re-run if any controls fail. Beginning in 2021, the batchID field can be used to connect the pathogen data to the lab quality assurance data.
