Only records in which sampleImpractical = OK (or NA, prior to the 2020 field season) in sls_soilCoreCollection are expected to have corresponding records in downstream tables. As such, users may wish to filter out records that do not meet this condition before proceeding with table joins.

An outline of the standard calculations for determining net N mineralization and net nitrification rates from inorganic N concentrations in initial and incubated cores can be found in the Appendix of the NEON User Guide to Soil inorganic nitrogen pools and transformations, included in the data package. The neonNTrans code package can be used to quickly make these calculations in R (https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-Nitrogen-Transformations).

A subset of inorganic nitrogen as well as total organic carbon and total nitrogen samples are analyzed in replicate for quality assurance, indicated by the analyticalRepNumber field. Replicates should typically be averaged to a single value per sample before proceeding with other analyses. Additionally, if total organic carbon and total nitrogen were analyzed separately (co2Trapped = N and Y, or acidTreatment = Y and N), users may wish to combine these values first before joining to other tables.
