Taxonomic identification, stem diameter, height, crown dimensions, observations of plant health and mapped location information and other measurements are recorded to enable estimation of biomass and production at multiple scales according to established allometries for the growth forms present across the NEON observatory. Data are collected with hand-held tools in the field, using standardized methods adopted from the forestry community. The temporal strategy is dependent on plot type; the full complement of tower plots is measured every 5 years, and a subset of tower plots are measured annually. Tower plots are established to overlap with the land surface that generates instrument based measurements of productivity from the surface-atmosphere exchange system. Distributed plots are measured every 5 years and provide a biomass snapshot across all vegetation types within a given NEON site.
