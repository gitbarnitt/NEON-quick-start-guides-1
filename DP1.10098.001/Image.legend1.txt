A 20 m x 20 m Distributed or small-stature Tower base plot (left), a 40 m x 40 m large-stature Tower base plot (right), and associated subplots and nested subplots used for measuring woody and other qualifying vegetation. Subplots that are 100 meters squared and larger are labeled like 'XX_YYY', where 'XX' denotes the point that anchors the southwest corner and 'YYY' indicates the area in meters squared. Nested subplots smaller than 100 meters squared are identified like 'XX_YY_Z', where the additional 'Z' component designates the corner (black italics) in which the nested subplot is established within the 10 m x 10 m base unit.
