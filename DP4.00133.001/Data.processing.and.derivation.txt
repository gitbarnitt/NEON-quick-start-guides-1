Rating curves are developed using Bayesian BaRatin software (Le Coz et al., 2014; Horner et al., 2018). Hydraulic controls based on surveys of the stream/river bed morphology at the discharge cross-section are used to develop the “prior” rating curve. Inputs that define the controls include channel slope, channel geometry, and channel roughness (see https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/tree/master/hydrologicControls for code used to develop the controls used as Bayesian priors). Detailed information on the prior controls are published in the sdrc_controlInfo, sdrc_controlType, and sdrc_priorParameters tables. A set of paired stage and discharge empirical measurements (from past and current water years) are used with the prior controls to create a posterior model in the BaRatin software (see https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-stream-discharge/tree/master/L4Discharge for code and more information on the software used to produce the rating curves). Rating curves are updated each water year (Oct 1 - Sept 30) and more than one rating curve may be produced for a given water year if conditions at the site change the relationship between stage and discharge mid-water year (e.g. an extremely high-flow event alters channel morphology) .
